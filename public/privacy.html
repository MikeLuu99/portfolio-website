    <h1>Privacy Policy for Search Shortcut Chrome Extension</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 09/01/2024</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy for the Search Shortcut Chrome Extension. This policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide through our extension. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We want to emphasize that the Search Shortcut extension is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. As such:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect any personal information.</li>
        <li>We do not track your browsing history.</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies or any other tracking technologies.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to any data you input while using our extension.</li>
        <li>We do not share any data with third parties, as we do not collect any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Storage Usage</h2>
    <p>The only data storage our extension utilizes is your browser's local storage. This is used solely for the purpose of storing your preferences and custom shortcuts to enhance your user experience. It's important to note that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data stored is kept exclusively on your device.</li>
        <li>We have no access to this locally stored data.</li>
        <li>No information is transmitted from your device to our servers or any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our extension requires certain permissions to function properly. These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the core functionality of our service and do not enable us to access any of your personal information. The permissions we require are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to the browser's address bar to detect and process search commands.</li>
        <li>Ability to redirect your search queries to the appropriate websites based on the commands you use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>Our extension may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our extension does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal information for you to access, correct, or delete. However, you always have the right to uninstall our extension at any time, which will remove any locally stored preferences.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
